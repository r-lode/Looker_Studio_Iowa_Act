## Project Description

The goal of this project was to develop an interactive dashboard to visualize yearly student act performance across Iowa. The end result is a visualization tool that allows the user to view composite and focus area act scores (English, Math, etc.) at the district level. District data is organized by year, allowing one to compare performance over time. This dashboard also allows one to compare district performance against yearly statewide averages[^1]. College readiness metrics are also visualized in the final pane. The process by which I collected and cleaned the data can be seen in the accompanying jupyter notebook.

[^1]: **Important Note:** These calculated averages are not of aggregate student performance, but averages of school performance. This dashboard is not an analytical tool to assess performance at the student level.
